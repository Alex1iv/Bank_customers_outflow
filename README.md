### Project description
It was created an ensamble ML model to predict the client outflow from a certain bank. 


### Data
The clients data base was taken from the [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers) website.

### Inference
Gone clients median age was 45 years. The majority of those clients are women living in Germany, France and Spain. They were depositing money on their saving accounts rather than usig them for day-to-day expenditure with their credit cards. In order to retain those customers it can be suggested for the bank management to offer higher interest rate for client saving accounts. It would be effectively especially after the 1st, 4th and 5th years since the beginning of the banking product usage by those clents
